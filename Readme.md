# Download open-access Springer eBooks
Do you want to get a bunch of very good quality ebooks about programming, robotics, psychology, etc? 
First some context:

* Springer editorial have a big number of [open access books](https://www.springeropen.com/books).

* Besides that, these days they have announced that, because of the Coronavirus pandemic, they would like to help people with learning material, thus [launching a global program.](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/news-events/all-news-articles/industry-news-initiatives/free-access-to-textbooks-for-institutions-affected-by-coronaviru/17855960)

This repository contains a compilation of links to these open-access books and a Python script to download them.

**Note**: this script is not portable at all as it includes a system call to use the ```wget``` tool in Linux. However, it would be pretty easy to substitute this with a call to the ```wget``` python library.

**Disclaimer**: I have no relationship with Springer, neither they have relation with this code.
